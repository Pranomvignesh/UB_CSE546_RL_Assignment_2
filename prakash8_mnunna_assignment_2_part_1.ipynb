        "The environment consists of the following objects:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Agent** - The agent starts in the grid block at the bottom left corner whose co-ordinates are [0, 0]. The goal of our agent is to collect the Gold while avoiding the Wumpus and the pits. \n",

        "2. **Wumpus** - The monster which would eat the agent if they are in the same grid block.\n",
